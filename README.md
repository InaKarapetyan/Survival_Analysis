# Customer Survival Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn using different techniques and provide insights to help businesses better understand and manage customer retention. The analysis involves exploring various factors affecting churn risk, interpreting model coefficients, identifying valuable customer segments, and estimating the annual retention budget based on customer lifetime value (CLV) and survival probabilities. Everything is based on ATF models!

## Dataset
The dataset telco.csv used for this analysis contains information about customers, including demographic attributes (age, gender, marital status), service usage (tenure, internet usage, voice service), and churn status. Additionally, CLV values are calculated for each customer.
